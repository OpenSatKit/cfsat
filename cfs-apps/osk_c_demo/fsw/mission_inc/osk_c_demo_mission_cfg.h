/*
** Purpose: Define configurations for the OSK C Demo application
**
** Notes:
**   1. Compile-time configurations that are applied to all platform
**      deployments of this app for a mission.
**   2. These definitions should be minimal and only contain parameters that
**      need to be configurable for a mission and that must be defined at
**      compile time. Use osk_c_demo_platform_cfg.h for compile-time
**      parameters that can be tuned for each platform deployment. Use
**      app_cfg.h for compile-time parameters that don't need to be
**      configured when an app is deployed but are useful to be parameterized
**      for maintaining the app and use the JSON initialization file for
**      parameters that can be defined at runtime.
