**  Purpose:
**    Define mission scope configurations for the OSK C Demo application
**
**  Notes:
**    1. Compile-time configurations that are applied to all platform
**       deployments of this app for a mission.
**    2. These definitions should be minimal and only contain parameters that
**       need to be configurable for a mission and that must be defined at
**       compile time. Use osk_c_demo_platform_cfg.h for compile-time
**       parameters that can be tuned for each platform deployment. Use
**       app_cfg.h for compile-time parameters that don't need to be
**       configured when an app is deployed but are useful to be parameterized
**       for maintaining the app and use the JSON initialization file for
**       parameters that can be defined at runtime.
