/*
** Purpose: Define platform configurations for the OpenSat Kit Scheduler application
**
** Notes:
**   1. These definitions should be minimal and only contain parameters that
**      need to be configurable and that must be defined at compile time.  
**      Use app_cfg.h for compile-time parameters that don't need to be
**      configured when an app is deployed and the JSON initialization
**      file for parameters that can be defined at runtime.
**   2. v3.0: These need to be scrubbed to determine which parameters should be
**      here versus app_cfg.h or the JSON init file. 
**
** References:
**   1. OpenSatKit Object-based Application Developer's Guide and the
**      osk_c_demo app that illustrates best practices with comments.  
**   2. cFS Application Developer's Guide.
